# JPMorgan_Internship_Question_1  Repository Structure and Version Notes

## Deprecated Content
All files within the `Version1_not_used` folder were initially committed on **2025/11/23**. As the project progressed, critical issues and limitations were identified in this early version. **This folder and its contents are now considered obsolete and should not be referenced for current development or implementation.** Please rely exclusively on the latest code versions provided in the directories below.

## Active Model Directories

### 1. Theory_based_Model
This directory contains a fully redesigned theoretical model built upon the foundational work of:
- Pareja (2007)
- Pareja (2009)
- Pelaez (2011)

All associated datasets and supporting documentation for this theoretical framework have been fully uploaded and are ready for reference/use.

### 2. ML_Enhanced_Model
This directory houses a novel machine learning model developed with the following methodologies:
- Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)
- Quantile Regression
- Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) principles

The complete implementation, including model code, training scripts, and relevant data, has been uploaded in full and represents the latest iteration of the ML-driven approach.
